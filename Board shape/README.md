Board outline for hourglass shaped PCB
======================================

The shape is drawn" in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (source file: [hourglass.svg](./hourglass.svg)) and then exported in [DXF](./hourglass.dxf) format using [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) (see the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more details).

The intention is to import the DXF into PCB design software and use it as a PCB's outline mechanical layer.
